# Julia Function Bug: Incomplete Input Range Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia: incomplete handling of input ranges in conditional statements. The function `myfunction` is designed to perform different operations based on the input value, but it has a gap in the logic that results in unexpected behavior for inputs between 5 and 10.

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.jl` provides a corrected version that addresses the issue.

## Bug Description:

The `myfunction` function fails to handle input values between 5 and 10 inclusive. This results in an implicit return of 0, which might not be the intended behavior.  This type of logic gap is easy to miss during initial development, particularly in functions with many conditional branches.
